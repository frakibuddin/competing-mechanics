                            owners, like me, who know little to nothing about auto repairs. I used to dread the car
                            repair experience. I found it intimidating. Often I'd accept an offer hearing no other
                            quotes. I knew that wasn't smart. While I don't know cars, I do know how to shop and I know
                            that good shopping will often produce good deals. Unfortunately, shopping for auto repairs
                            has never favored car owners. I wanted to change that. Both car owners and mechanics tell me
                            I did. I'd like to hear from you. If you find the experience pleasant, tell a friend. If
